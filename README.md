# Solving Leetcode Questions Daily 
Welcome to my "Leetcode Daily Practice" repository! In this repository, I document my daily journey of learning data structures and algorithms by solving Leetcode questions using Python. The purpose of this project is to improve my problem-solving skills, reinforce my knowledge of Python, and gain a deeper understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms.
## Motivation
I decided to start this project to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. Leetcode is a great platform to practice coding and it has a vast collection of problems on data structures and algorithms. By solving one problem every day, I hope to reinforce my knowledge of Python, improve my problem-solving skills, and gain a deeper understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms.

## Methodology
To achieve these goals, I have set a goal to solve at least one Leetcode question every day. I will solve the problem using Python, and I will write my thought process and approach (in Chinese) to solving the problem in the python file respectively. 
After solving the problem, I will submit my solution to Leetcode to check if it passes all the test cases. If my solution is correct, I will upload the solution file to the repository. If my solution is incorrect, I will analyze my mistake and attempt to correct it.

## Resources
Here are some resources that helped me along the way:
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - the platform I use to practice coding.
- [Visualgo](http://visualgo.net/) - a visualizer for various data structures and algorithms.

## Remarks
Note that while I aim to solve one Leetcode question every day, there may be days when I am unable to do so due to other commitments such as assignments, exams, or events. I will try my best to stay consistent with this practice, but I also recognize the importance of prioritizing other responsibilities when necessary.

## Conclusion
By following this daily practice of solving Leetcode questions using Python, I hope to improve my problem-solving skills, reinforce my knowledge of Python, and gain a deeper understanding of the most important data structures and algorithms. I invite you to follow along with me on this journey and join me in improving your own skills in data structures and algorithms.
